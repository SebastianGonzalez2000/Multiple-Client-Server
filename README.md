# Multiple-Client-Server

Windows Clients can connect to this server while its running by using PuTTY. Once all clients are connected you can type in any message and your message will be broadcasted to any other clients that have connected to the same server with the same IP Address and tcp port. The backend of this project was built to handle multiple clients all at once.

Skills I improved during this project:
 - Networking protocol fundamentals
 - Dynamic use of Visual Studio Code for C++ and the use of the debugger
 - Socket and Networking programming in C++
